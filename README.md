* A python script that scrapes finviz.com for news articles about certain stock tickers.
* Uses Beautiful Soup to scrape and clean this information
* Run a sentiment analysis on the titles of the articles using the NLTK package
* Use pandas and matplotlib to generate a bar chart to better visualize the data

* There are still some features I would like to implement:
   - Ask the user what tickers they would like to run the analysis on
   - A way to compare the sentiment analysis on past articles against the actual change in stock value
